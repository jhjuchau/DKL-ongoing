KINDA URGENT:
~Change Grandaddy Purple to God's Gift



SYSTEM MECHANICS

~ Allow user to input character names, so that everyone has a personal experience.
-- Randomized name entry? Like "Enter a name of someone you know, type 'DONE' when you're finished, enter as many as you want."
*probably the safest, keep a library of generic names to fill the gaps if there are any
-- Qualitative name entry? LIke "Enter a name of a shy friend. Enter a name of a brave friend. ENter the name of your best friend."
*people might not have enough friends to name everybody








TEXT CHANGES
~ More description on Bee's office: bookshelves along both sides, a huge covered window behind her chair
~ if (you.name=="David") in the store, add flavor text. (maybe the Store David calls you "Divad" or something)
~ Add if (you.name=="Greg"||you.name=="Naruto"){cout<<"Believe it."<<endl;} to a bunch of lines


EVENTS
~ Alex Boss Fight if you choose to walk out of Bee's Office
~ David Aribal saves you if you were friendly to him in Bee's Office

~Alternate Timelines -- if Bee puts you comatose, you wake up after the Dank One has been resurrected
